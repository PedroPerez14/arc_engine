Will write a proper readme later on development when this hot mess resembles a real engine

For now I'm slowly going over all TheCherno's Game Engine tutorials because I want to learn stuff instead of just having an engine to show that isn't actually mine
So yeah, I'm pretty slow because I'm constantly googling things like "std::placeholder::_1" and taking handwritten notes

And also I'm trying to read Game Engine Architecture (you guessed it, while also taking handwritten notes)

My bad for taking computer science instead of software engineering :/

Currently the plan is to have a minimally viable engine and do a silly little game to test it, and then go all in into the graphics and rendering side, since I want to focus on graphics and rendering. Might want to recreate algorithms like Ambient Occlusion, or just analyze the look of a certain videogame to copy it form just visual references

Anyway, thank you for reading this!
